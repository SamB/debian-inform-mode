Subject: [Announce] inform-mode 1.5.1 released

This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode. The
code has been uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.gmd.de and should
soon be moved to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available
from the new inform-mode home page:
	 http://www.merguez.demon.co.uk/inform-mode/

inform-mode is a major mode for emacs used to edit programs written in
the Inform programming language. It supports the usual program mode
functions: automatic indentation, moving over expressions, comment and
string filling, font locking, tags-file support, starting compiles and
parsing errors. It should work on GNU Emacs (v20) or XEmacs (v20/21)
on any supported platform.

Changes in this version:

* Byte-compilation should work on GNU Emacs.
* Indentation bug in first property of class or object fixed. 

If you find any bugs please report them to me at
   rupert@merguez.demon.co.uk. 
I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode. In
future versions I am planning to add the ability to spell-check
program text and better integration with interpreters to speed up the
write/compile/test cycle.
