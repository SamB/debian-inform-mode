This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode. The
code has been uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.gmd.de and should
soon be moved to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available
from the inform-mode home page:
	http://www.merguez.demon.co.uk/inform-mode/

Version 1.5.5 fixes a few more bugs. In detail:
* strings with '^' and '//' are now fontified properly
* non-directives ending with directive names (eg 'JObject') are now 
  fontified properly
* comment line-up (ie with inform-comments-line-up-p non-nil) is no
  longer confused by '!' in code
* multi-line switch labels indented properly
* indentation of multi-line strings now handled by inform-strings-line-up-p 


If you find any bugs please report them to me at
	rupert@merguez.demon.co.uk. 
I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode.
