Subject: [Announce] inform-mode 1.5.0 released

This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode. The
code has been uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.gmd.de and should
soon be moved to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available
from the new inform-mode home page:
	 http://www.merguez.demon.co.uk/inform-mode/

inform-mode is a major mode for emacs used to edit programs written in
the Inform programming language. It supports the usual program mode
functions: automatic indentation, moving over expressions, comment and
string filling, font locking, tags-file support, starting compiles and
parsing errors. It should work on GNU Emacs (v20) or XEmacs (v20/21)
on any supported platform.

The changes made in this version are mostly to bring the mode up to
date with Inform 6: the emacs user interface remains the same.

In detail, the changes are:

* Understands all Inform 6.21 directives and library 6/10 attributes and
  properties.
* Indents if-else blocks correctly,
* Font locking for Inform routine code as well as object/class definitions.
* New keywords can be added easily as font locking regexps are
  calculated at mode eval time.
* inform-indent-line (TAB) moves point in a similar way to other major
  modes.
* When filling strings, backslashes are no longer added.
* Tags files can now be created on non-Unix platforms.
* More object and routine definitions are now identified properly when
  creating tage files.

If you find any bugs please report them to me at
   rupert@merguez.demon.co.uk. 
I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode. In
future versions I am planning to add the ability to spell-check
program text and better integration with interpreters to speed up the
write/compile/test cycle.
