inform-mode: an Emacs major mode for editing Inform source code.

Introduction
------------

inform-mode supports the usual program mode functions: automatic
indentation, moving over expressions, comment and string filling, font
locking, tags-file support, starting compiles and parsing errors. You
can also run a z-code interpreter against the compiled code.

It should work on GNU Emacs (v22+) or XEmacs (v21.4+) on any supported
platform.


Installing inform-mode

in .inf (and optionally .h) when you visit them using Emacs. Type 'C-h
m' to view the documentation for the mode. Variables governing
inform-mode can be customized; type 'M-x customize' and navigate to
Programming / Languages / inform-mode.
