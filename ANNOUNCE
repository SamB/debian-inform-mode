Subject:  [Announce] emacs inform-mode 1.5.3 released

This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode. The
code has been uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.gmd.de and should
soon be moved to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available
from the inform-mode home page:
    http://www.merguez.demon.co.uk/inform-mode/

Version 1.5.3 fixes the following bug:

* Dictionary words are fontified using font-lock-constant-face. 
   
If you find any bugs please report them to me at
     rupert@merguez.demon.co.uk.

I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode. In
future versions I am planning to add Customize support and better
integration with interpreters to speed up the write/compile/test
cycle.
   
inform-mode is a major mode for the emacs text editor used to edit
programs written in the Inform programming language. It supports the
usual program mode functions: automatic indentation, moving over
expressions, comment and string filling, font locking, tags-file
support, starting compiles and parsing errors. It should work on GNU
Emacs (v20) or XEmacs (v20/21) on any supported platform.

inform-mode was originally written by Gareth Rees and was previously
maintained by Michael Fessler. It is free software; you can
redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
