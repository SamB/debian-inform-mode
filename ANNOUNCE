Subject: [ANNOUNCE] emacs inform-mode 1.5.7 released

This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode, a
major mode for editing Inform files in Emacs.  The code has been
uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.ifarchive.org and should soon be moved
to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available from the
inform-mode home page:
        http://rupert-lane.org/inform-mode/

Changes in version 1.5.7:

* Fixed bug in fontification on GNU Emacs 21

If you find any bugs please report them to me at
        rupert@rupert-lane.org
I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode.
