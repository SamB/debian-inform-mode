This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode. The
code has been uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.gmd.de and should
soon be moved to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available
from the inform-mode home page:
	http://www.merguez.demon.co.uk/inform-mode/

Version 1.5.4 fixes a few minor bugs. In detail:
* Dictionary words are now fontified using
  inform-dictionary-word-face, as font-lock-constant-face is not
  available on all Emacsen.
* Actions (eg ##Examine) are indented properly.

If you find any bugs please report them to me at
	rupert@merguez.demon.co.uk. 
I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode.
