This is to announce the release of a new version of inform-mode. The
code has been uploaded to incoming/if-archive on ftp.gmd.de and should
soon be moved to if-archive/programming/editors. It is also available
from the inform-mode home page:
	http://www.merguez.demon.co.uk/inform-mode/

Version 1.5.6 fixes a few more bugs. In detail:
* Recognise 'private' keyword
* Fontify object name after '->' properly
* Fontify dictionary words containing '-' properly
* Fontify 1-character dictionary words properly
* Fontify 'with name' properly
* Correct fontification of char before attribute/property name
* Allow imenu to recognize objects with -> in their header

If you find any bugs please report them to me at
	rupert@merguez.demon.co.uk. 
I am also interested in any ideas you have to improve the mode.
